## Introduction
In this assignment I drafted a formal government enquiry and used an AI agent to help structure and refine it. The task deepened my understanding of Hong Kong's data access pathways and the role of clear instruction writing in research and policymaking.

## Main Body
I found that while many high-level datasets and policy documents are publicly available, more detailed operational or granular datasets often require formal requests. Identifying the exact data needed proved challenging; it required balancing specificity without over-constraining the request. The AI agent was particularly helpful in clarifying the enquiry structure, suggesting relevant data categories and polishing the language for professional tone. Compared with a customised chatbot tutor, this AI assisted more directly with task-oriented drafting and formatting. Through the process I improved skills in articulating data needs, crafting concise professional communication, and planning fallback options if requests are denied.

## Conclusion
This exercise highlighted that access to government data can significantly strengthen policy analysis, but effective enquiry drafting and contingency planning are crucial. I will continue applying these skills in future projects to support robust, evidence-based policymaking.
