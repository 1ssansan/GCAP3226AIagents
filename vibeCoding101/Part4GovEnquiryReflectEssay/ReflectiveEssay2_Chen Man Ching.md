In this assignment, I drafted a formal enquiry to a Hong Kong government department and used an AI agent to refine the structure and tone. The task enhanced my understanding of public data governance and the importance of clarity in research communication.


Through this project, I learned that Hong Kong provides relatively good access to high-level statistics and policy documents through its open data portal, but detailed operational or granular datasets often require formal requests. Identifying the precise data needed was challengingâ€”it required defining a clear scope without limiting flexibility. Crafting the enquiry also taught me how to use professional and respectful language when communicating with government agencies. The AI agent supported me by suggesting data categories, improving the tone, and ensuring logical flow. Compared to a customised chatbot tutor, this AI offered more focused, task-oriented support, helping me improve practical skills such as drafting formal requests, planning backup data sources, and managing professional correspondence.


This exercise deepened my appreciation for transparent data governance and strategic enquiry writing. I will continue applying these skills in future research projects to strengthen data-driven policy analysis and evidence-based decision-making.
