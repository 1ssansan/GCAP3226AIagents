Reflective Essay 2 — Team 3 (Typhoon)

In our Typhoon Preparedness & Emergency Management project, I learned how data-driven methods can inform public policy decisions under uncertainty. Our team analysed historical typhoon records, wind observations from multiple stations, and damage reports to evaluate the timing and accuracy of the Observatory's decision to hoist Signal No. 8. My role included compiling data sources, drafting the information request to the Hong Kong Observatory, and synthesizing meeting notes into an initial analysis plan. The project highlighted the importance of focusing on observations close to the decision window: short-term, high-frequency wind data around the announcement time matters more for decision accuracy than aggregated long-duration summaries. I gained practical experience considering both regression and simulation approaches — regression to quantify relationships between announcement timing and observed thresholds, and simulation to model evacuation and resource-allocation scenarios. Looking forward, I will work on translating model outputs into concrete policy recommendations (for example, an accuracy metric tied to decision lead-time) and clearer communication tools for stakeholders. I used AI tools to help summarise meeting transcripts and polish wording, but all analytical choices and interpretations reported here are my own.

Title: Reflective Essay 2 — Team 3 (Typhoon) — [Chen Man Ching]

Body:
1) Paste the reflective essay text above.
2) AI usage statement (required): "I used the course AI tool to summarise meeting notes and refine phrasing. All analysis, interpretations, and conclusions in this submission are my own."

Optional short checklist to include in your reply:
- Project role: data compilation & correspondence with Observatory
- Methods considered: regression (timing vs accuracy) and simulation (evacuation/resource scenarios)
- Next steps: derive a decision lead-time accuracy metric and draft policy recommendations
